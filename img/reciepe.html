          <p>This food is the Italian pork and beef meat ball with polenta. This dish is good for the winter season. It is simply made by mixing the pork and beef mince together with finely chopped herbs like mint, parsley, rosemary, sage etc. and finely grated parmesan cheese with slight seasoning of salt and pepper.  	Then we make the balls from the mixture of mince and cook it with napolitana sauce (cooked tomato sauce with online and basil) for an hour. Then for polenta we boil the mixture half and half of milk and water. Then we add the polenta small amount at a time till the mixture thickens. Then we put the polenta on the base of the plate with meat balls on top of it and we ad grated cheese and parley as a garnish.</p>
